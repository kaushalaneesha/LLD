- The system can have n elevators. 
- Person can come and ask for an elevator to go down or up. 
- If the elevator is already going down it will serve the request to go down first, before going up. 
- Once an evevator is free it can go in any direction. 
- If going in one direction it will stop for people requesting to go in sane direction. 
- We can have a queue of requests in pipeline (so that once elevator is free it can serve that request)
